A train derails and we shout about the infrastructure needing repair, 
 though later we remember that we don't have trains across the country. 
 We can't remember the last time we took a train.

<p>
I tell you I want to care, that I know I should care. But it is all rain rolling off me. Emotions like runoff through the storm grates leave nothing behind.
</p>

<p>There is that chance though, that enough precipitant will erode a hole inside of me. Big enough to let in the environment. Big enough to find me caring again. I am holding on to that vulnerability, open-eyes for that piercing moment. Big enough to destroy me.
</p>

<p>
Everything within is just that.
